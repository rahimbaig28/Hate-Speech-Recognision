# Experiment Notebook

## Description

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`Experiment.ipynb`) that analyzes imbalanced data for classification, specifically focusing on detecting hate speech. The notebook utilizes Pandas for data processing and likely employs machine learning techniques to handle class imbalance.

## Installation

To run this notebook, you need to have Python installed along with the necessary dependencies. Follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```
2. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd <repository_name>
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook Experiment.ipynb
   ```
2. Execute the cells sequentially to process the imbalanced dataset and analyze the results.

## Dependencies

Ensure the following Python libraries are installed:

- Pandas
- Jupyter Notebook
- Any other dependencies required by the notebook (add them to `requirements.txt`)



## Data

The notebook loads and processes an imbalanced dataset (`imbalanced_data.csv`). Ensure this file is available in the working directory before running the notebook.
